Mummies (Spanish: Momias), is a 2023 English-language Spanish animated comedy film directed by Juan Jesús García Galocha (in his feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by Javier López Barreira and Jordi Gasull and a story by Gasull. It features the voices of Joe Thomas, Eleanor Tomlinson, Celia Imrie, Hugh Bonneville and Sean Bean.[6]

Initially scheduled for release in 2021, Mummies was theatrically released in Spain on February 24, 2023.[7]

Premise[edit]

The film follows three mummies from the underworld who embark on a journey and end up in present-day London in search of an old ring belonging to an Ancient Egyptian Royal Family that was stolen from a tomb by the ambitious archaeologist Lord Carnaby, whose goal is to kidnap Princess Nefer for an exhibition after her irrepressible singing goes viral. The mummies end up in several hilarious situations as they try to understand and adapt to 21st century London in an obvious culture clash.
